Node.js Callbacks & Events Playground

A step-by-step playground to learn callback patterns and the EventEmitter in Node.js. Each topic lives in a numbered directory (00, 01, …) and evolves with small commits.

Index
- 00-callbacks-cps: Continuation-Passing Style basics (sync vs async), Node-style callbacks.
- 01-…: To be added next (unpredictable functions, Zalgo, deferred execution, conventions, EventEmitter, etc.).

How to run
Use Node.js to run any example file directly:

`node 00-callbacks-cps/01-sync-cps.js`
